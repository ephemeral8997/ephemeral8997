# Hi, I'm ephemeral8997

Self-taught developer with nearly a decade of hands-on experience.  
I focus on building practical tools, automating tasks, and solving problems through code.

## Skills & Tools

- Languages: Python, Lua 5.3, HTML, CSS, SQL, Regex, Bash
- Familiar with: Networking basics, cryptography concepts, web server setup
- Past experience: JavaScript and Node.js (not currently active)

## What I Do

I’ve built a wide range of things: bots, scripts, utilities, workflow tools, broken system fixes, and more.  
I value clean logic, simplicity, and solving real-world problems.

## Why I’m Here

I’m not here to talk big. I’m here to do the work, improve steadily, and keep building what I know.  
This space is my archive, my lab, and my way of showing what I do best.
